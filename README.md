### What is CARL
CARL is a Unity-Application for the Microsoft HoloLens, that allows users to enter a shared virtual space together - even if they are in entirely different real spaces.Â 
This can be used to accomplish almost any design or coordination task, and the integrated data-collection to LabStreamingLayer allows for the collection of high fidelity motion data about the activity.
You can find more details & a video of CARL in action [on the github-page](https://cognitive-systems-lab.github.io/CARL-Collaborative-Augmented-Reality-for-LabLinking/).
